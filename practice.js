  In this repo your job is to write functions to make each function call work properly.

  Here's an example of code that will be given to you:

  sayHi('Hi Katie', function(thingToSay){
    alert(thingToSay);
  });

  It would be your job to create the sayHi function:

  var sayHi = function(str, cb){
    cb(str);
  }
